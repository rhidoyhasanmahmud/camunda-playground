‚úÖ **What is Business Process Management (BPM)?**

‚úÖ **What is Business Process Modeling?**

Business Process Modeling is the visual representation of how a business process works.

It shows each step, decision, and actor involved using diagrams ‚Äî usually with BPMN (Business Process Model and
Notation).

`Think of it like drawing a flowchart to explain how work gets done in a company.`

üü¶ BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)

A visual language used to design and describe business processes using flowcharts.

Best for: Step-by-step workflows

Use when: You want to show how tasks flow in a process (start ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí decision ‚Üí end)

üü© DMN (Decision Model and Notation)

Used to model decision logic separately from the workflow.

Best for: Rules and decisions (if-else logic)

Use when: You need to define business rules like ‚ÄúIf age > 18 and income > $3000 ‚Üí approve‚Äù

üü® CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation)

Used for case-based processes where steps are not fixed or sequential.

Best for: Unstructured or flexible processes

Use when: The path changes based on what happens during the process ‚Äî not all steps are known in advance.
