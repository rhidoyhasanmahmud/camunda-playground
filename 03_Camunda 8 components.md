1. Modeler

* A drag-and-drop tool (desktop or web) for creating **BPMN, DMN, and forms**.
* Supports building workflows, decision tables, connectors, and form-based user tasks.

2. Workflow & Decision Engine (Zeebe)

* The core engine that executes **processes and decisions**.
* Cloud-native, scalable, distributed (no central DB), resilient, handles microservices orchestration

3. Tasklist

* A ready-to-use **UI for human task management**.
* Displays tasks assigned to users, supports assignment, scheduling, and completion

4. Operate

* A monitoring tool for **real-time workflow visibility**.
* Inspect running instances, identify issues, retry or resolve failed tasks.

5. Optimize

* Provides **analytics and reporting** for continuous process improvement.
* Generates dashboards, finds bottlenecks, and helps in performance analysis.

6. Console

* The **admin interface** for platform management.
* Used for managing clusters, environments, users, roles, alerts, and API clients.

7. Forms

* **Camunda Forms** allow you to build input screens for user tasks with no custom frontend code.
* Built using the Modeler or JSON schema.
* Displayed in Tasklist for data entry, review, or approvals.

8. Connectors

* Prebuilt or custom **integrations** for calling APIs, sending emails, posting messages to systems like Slack, etc.
* Attached to Service Tasks in BPMN.
* Reduces the need for writing code to handle external communication.
